Cybernomics is a scientific study of provable control, computing and communication in intelligent beings and between them.

I believe this transdisciplinary field of knowledge will help to design better [superintelligent systems](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics/blob/master/cybernetics/super-intelligence) and build better [applications](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics/blob/master/applications) on top of it. As humanity has never encountered such a phenomenon understanding of these concepts, it could also help with exploration and comprehension of superintelligence, as well as, with reasoning about their essence.

Cybernomics is a refinement of [cybernetics](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics/blob/master/cybernetics) in the sense that the majority of methods of cybernomics can be applied to cybernetics. But, fundamentals such as [asymmetric cryptography](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics/blob/master/cryptography/asymmetric), [consensus computing](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics/blob/master/computing/consensus-computing), [basic proof-systems](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics/blob/master/proof-systems) and [game-theoretic aspects](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics/blob/master/game-theory), especially in economics, have not existed when [cybernetics was born](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics/blob/master/cybernetics/weiner-cybernetics.pdf). The biggest shift from cybernetics is in philosophy. Cybernomics stands on the solid idea that our universe is [just an instance](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics/blob/master/philosophy/simulation.pdf) of a metastable program which runs inside a [superintelligent consensus computer](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics/blob/master/computing/consensus-computing). My bet is that this assumption will allow us to make predictions more reliable, no matter how weird they are.

The project is in its infancy. I decided to start by open-sourcing my library which I structured for the last 7 years of researching the field. The thing looks very complex. Some areas are well understood by me, some are not. I am going to work on The library as my pet project, and hopefully, sometimes this thing will evolve into an interactive book on the foundations of cybernomics. My incentive is the contribution to [the idea of the Great Web](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmceNpj6HfS81PcCaQXrFMQf7LR5FTLkdG9sbSRNy3UXoZ). You can help to build these foundations, so don't hesitate - [pull requests](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics/pulls) await you.

You can [surf The library also in ipfs](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmY8vW6cAw1dGudT1gU71jL5Nqc8kTpYMLwR7jRX7rziCR)!
